The first time I tried running a Three JS Scene on a React project I encountered a couple of problems until I eventually got the shtick of it, I hope this article and repository will save some developers a couple of precious hours.

You can either clone my boilerplate and start working from there or you can follow my guide on how to start a basic React + Three project from scratch.

# Using the boilerplate
 **Step 1** Clone the repo 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/tk-ni/React-JS-Three-JS-Boilerplate.git
```

**Step 2** In the main repo directory open a CMD/Terminal and type in these commands.

```
npm install
npm start
```

The boilerplate includes a basic project structure and basic scene <i>**MainScene.component.js**</i> already imported in App.js.

Feel free to modify/copy/replace the MainScene component or anything else to fit your project's needs.

The boilerplate's folder structure follows the basic CRA template structure with a few modifications.

> - public <br>
> - src
>   - Assets ```- Store all your 3D Models/Textures/Graphics.```
>   - Scenes ```- Store all your scenes React components. ```
>   - Styles ```- Store all your CSS/SASS files. ```
>   - App.js
>   - index.js
